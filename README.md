# OpenCV Tutorial By Bhupeshwar Pathania
OpenCV, short for Open Source Computer Vision Library, is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. Originally developed by Intel, it is now maintained by a community of developers under the OpenCV Foundation.

# What is OpenCV?

OpenCV is a Python open-source library for computer vision in artificial intelligence, machine learning, facial recognition, etc.

The term "computer vision" (abbreviated as "CV") in OpenCV refers to a branch of research that enables computers to comprehend the content of digital images like pictures and movies.

To comprehend the content of the images is the goal of computer vision. 
It takes the description of the images-which may be of an object, a text description, a three-dimensional model, etc.-and extracts it from the images. Computer vision, 
for instance, can help cars by enabling them to recognize various roadside items, such as pedestrians, traffic signs, and traffic lights, and then respond appropriately.

# How does the Computer Recognize the Image?

Human eyes provide a lot of information based on what they observe. 
Machines can observe everything, translate that vision into numbers, and store those numbers in memory. 
Here, the issue of how computers translate visuals into numbers arises. 
The pixel value is utilized to translate images into numbers, which is the answer.
A pixel is a minor component of a digital picture or graphic that can be shown on a digital display device.

The numbers show how bright the image is at that specific location. 
In the image above, I've demonstrated how a grayscale image's pixel values comprise just one value-the intensity of the black color there.

There are two typical techniques to recognize the pictures:

1. Grayscale:

Images that just include the two colors black and white are known as grayscale images. 
Black is considered to have the lowest intensity, whereas white has the highest, according to the contrast assessment of intensity. 
The computer gives each pixel in the grayscale image a value dependent on how dark it is when we use it.

2. RGB:

An RGB is a mixture of red, green, and blue that results in a new color. 
The computer extracts Each pixel's value, which then organizes the information into an array for interpretation.

# Why OpenCV is used for Computer Vision?

1. OpenCV can be downloaded for nothing.
2. The OpenCV library is relatively quick because it is written in C/C++. Python can now be used with it.
3. It could use as little as 60-70 MB of RAM.
4. As OpenCV, computer vision is portable and may be used with any C-capable device.


# Prerequisite

You must have a foundational understanding of Python programming before learning OpenCV.
